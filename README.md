# DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2020 Challenge

## Our Problem

Working from home sent us all well... home.

But we still like to get together for beer once in a while (according to regulations of course).

Our lives changed and getting the schedule to work is hard.

## The Solution

That is where you come in!

Each person wrote when they are available.

Each person also wrote when we can meet at their house.

We need a program to make sense of it and tell us when are we meeting!

## Resources:

Here is a log excerpt from slack with what everyone wrote.
Full log is under log.txt

```
Gil: I can do Wednesday at 18:00
Eli: I can do Monday at 13:00
Andrii: My yard is available Thursday at 16:00
George: My yard is available Sunday at 16:00
Daniel: My yard is available Monday at 10:00
```

Your program will read this file, and output something that looks like:
```
We will meet at Gil's house on Tueday between 1700-1800
```

## Guidelines

### Programmatic solution

In case this wasn't obvious, you need to write code to process this.

### Unknown amount of responses

You do not know how many people will respond.

If there are multiple options that work, pick one at random.

### Contest Guidelines

We like golang, but any programming language would be fine.

We will be giving away 2 sets of Sony Active Noise cancelling true wireless earbuds

First set will go to the first person who solved it, 

Second set will be raffled off between the rest of the solvers.

We will send them to your house after the event.

### Show me it works and win!

Demo and explain your working code to an Appsflyer engineer on discord via video chat.

We will be available on the sponsor channel.

### FAQ

#### What if there is no option ?
Then say there is no option, but this is not likely.

#### How many participants ?
Whoever answered the survey.

#### Do I have to show my code ?
Yes.

#### What Languages can I use ?
Anything that you can show me running on your laptop via a 5 min zoom session

#### Is this an actual log ?
We created a generator for this,
and if you think the input is faulty,
we can generate new input upon request.
